<p>German car brands are known for manufacturing high-class vehicles that consistently exceed driver expectations as far as performance and appearance are concerned. This reputation makes these brands the leaders in automotive production worldwide, with many of their marques ranking higher than similar American, Japanese, and Korean car brands. And German car brands also feature a long history of innovative technologies and cutting-edge engineering — advances which were subsequently adopted by other European car companies. Plus, many of these vehicles just look stellar. From supercars to SUVs, these manufacturers have made some of the models that serious gearheads covet.</p>

<h2>A Brief History of German Car Brands</h2>

<p>German car history began in 1870 when Nikolaus Otto and Karl Benz invented the 4-stroke internal combustion engine. These two mechanical engineers helped Germany launch into the automotive production business. By 1901, about 900 cars were being produced annually in Germany. Today, Germany has one of the largest automotive workforces in the world. According to Worldometers, Germany is the third-largest auto manufacturing country after China and Japan. And these brands aren’t just about quantity, as they also routinely claim top-marks for quality too.In 2021, German car brands claimed three World Car Awards, including the World Car of the Year (Volkswagen ID.4), the World Luxury Car (Mercedes-Benz S-Class), and the World Performance Car (Porsche 911 Turbo).</p>
